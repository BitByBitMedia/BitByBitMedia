            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                At Bit by Bit Media, we believe that great content isn’t about chasing algorithms — it’s about building genuine connections through shared passion.
                Founded by creators who live and breathe gaming, movies, and tech, we’re dedicated to bringing you honest, engaging, and community-driven coverage.
                Our mission is simple: to celebrate the culture we love, one bit at a time.
            </p>

            <p>
                We go beyond the headlines and hype, diving deep into what makes games, shows, and technology matter.
                Whether it’s in-depth discussions on our **Bit by Bit Podcast**, weekly Twitch streams, or detailed video breakdowns,
                we aim to deliver thoughtful commentary that entertains, informs, and sparks conversation.
                Every piece of content is crafted with care, authenticity, and respect for both creators and audiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                But Bit by Bit Media is more than just content — it’s a community.
                We work to create a welcoming space where fans and creators alike can connect, collaborate, and make an impact.
                With **20% of our merchandise proceeds going to charity each month**, we’re committed to giving back while growing together.
                From our humble beginnings to what’s ahead, we’re proud to build something that truly belongs to everyone, bit by bit.
